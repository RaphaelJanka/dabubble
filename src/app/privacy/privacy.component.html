<h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
<h3>Data Protection</h3>

<p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
<h3>Note on the Responsible Party</h3>
<p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
<p>Raphael Janka<br />
    Birkhahnweg 47<br />
    81827 Munich</p>
<p>Tel: +49 172 4327592<br />
    Email: raphael.janka&#64;gmail.com</p>
<p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
<h3>Storage Duration</h3>
<p>Unless a specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we have no other legally permissible reasons for storage (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
<h3>General Information on Data Processing Legal Bases on this Website</h3>
<p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, we will process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed. In case of an explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the processing will also take place based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

<h3>Information on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</h3>
<p>A data transfer to the USA takes place on the basis of your consent according to Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The recipient of the data is Google Firebase, an affiliated company of Google LLC, based in the USA. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country within the meaning of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as the data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. secret services) process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>
<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING REASONS FOR PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
<h3>Right to File Complaints with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
<h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Encrypted Payment Transactions on this Website</h3>
<p>If, after the conclusion of a contract with costs, there is an obligation to provide us with your payment details (e.g., account number for direct debit authorization), this data is required for payment processing.</p>
<p>Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
<p>In the case of encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint.</p>
<h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the audit, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
  <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/happens unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have filed an objection under Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests predominate, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
<h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
<p>The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>

<h3>Inquiry via Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
<p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed for the purpose of processing your request. We do not disclose these data without your consent.</p>
<p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided your inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries directed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>The data you send us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after completing the processing of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

<h2>5. Plugins and Tools</h2>

<h3>Google Fonts</h3>
<p>This site uses so-called Google Fonts for the uniform display of fonts, provided by Google. When a page is accessed, your browser loads the required fonts into its browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the browser you are using must establish a connection to Google's servers. Google thus becomes aware that this website was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Fonts is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the uniform presentation of the typeface on its website. If the corresponding consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, to the extent that the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>If your browser does not support Google Fonts, a default font will be used by your computer.</p>
<p>Further information about Google Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p>
